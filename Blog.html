                    <p>The majority of Van Gogh's best-known works were produced during the final two years of his life. During the fall and winter of 1888, Vincent
                         Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin lived and worked together in Arles in the south of France, where Van Gogh eventually rented four rooms at 2 Place
                          Lamartine, which was dubbed the "Yellow House" for its citron hue. The move to Provence began as a plan for a new artist's community in Arles
                           as alternative to Paris and came at a critical point in each of the artists' careers. While at the "Yellow House" Gauguin and Van Gogh worked 
                           closely together and developed a concept of color symbolic of inner emotion and not dependent upon nature. Despite enormous productivity, 
                           Van Gogh suffered from various bouts of mental instability, likely including epilepsy, psychotic episodes, delusions, and bipolar disorder.
                            Gauguin left for Tahiti, partially as a means of escaping Van Gogh's increasingly erratic behavior. The artist slipped away after a particularly
                             violent fight in which Van Gogh threatened Gauguin with a razor and then cut off part of his own left ear. </p>

                    <p>An art gallery is a room or a building in which visual art is displayed. In Western cultures from the mid-15th century, a gallery was any long,
                         narrow covered passage along a wall, first used in the sense of a place for art in the 1590s. The long gallery in Elizabethan and Jacobean 
                         houses served many purposes including the display of art. Historically, art is displayed as evidence of status and wealth, and for religious 
                         art as objects of ritual or the depiction of narratives. The first galleries were in the palaces of the aristocracy, or in churches. As art 
                         collections grew, buildings became dedicated to art, becoming the first art museums.</p>
